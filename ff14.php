<h2>Final Fantasy XIV</h2>

<img class="descriptionPic" src="images/ff14b.jpg" alt="ff14 gameplay">

<p class="description">Final Fantasy XIV is another online MMORPG, similar to XI. This time,
they based it in a completely different world with more cities and areas to travel to. When the
game first came out, it received a lot of negative reviews because of how poorly the battle
system and the level up systems were executed. However, a few years later, they release a updated
version of the game called A Realm Reborn. They polished a lot of the aspects that were considered
bad in the old game, and this one received a lot more positive reviews. The level up system follows
a traditional system. The player levels up and gains stats and skill points. The player can put those
points into any skills they want. The class system, however, is very unique to the genre. It requires that you
simply change weapons in order to change classes. A specific weapon will turn you into that weapon's corresponding
class. There are also secondary classes, that require the player to level up two primary classes to specific levels in order
to upgrade to the class.</p>
